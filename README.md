# Speeches

Application Requirements
A politician will give many speeches in their political career. Many politicians currently draft their speeches in an ad-hoc fashion using Microsoft Word and share versions with their team using email. This process is inefficient as it does not allow for the users to centrally store, archive, and search their speeches.  This challenge will require you to design a portion of a system to automate this process. 
For the tech challenge, this system will have the capability for a politician to do the following:  
1.	View all their speeches saved in the system.  
2.	Add a speech to the system (for this challenge we will consider a speech to have the actual text, the author information, keywords about the speech and a speech date). 
3.	Edit a speech or its metadata
4.	Delete a speech
5.	The ability to search the speeches â€“ (search by author, date range, subject area, or snippets of text from the speech body.

Part 1: Develop the backend application to meet the functionality of the five requirements listed above. 
For this technical challenge, you will need to develop the back end application and its related data model. Each of the five requirements listed above should have a corresponding REST API to perform the corresponding functionality. There is no need to develop a front-end application to test these APIs - you can demonstrate these APIs by providing a set of API calls using curl, Restlet, Postman or another framework.  In addition to having the API calls, some basic unit tests should be developed to show your experience with JUnit.
This technical challenge should be developed using Java, Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate and Mapstruct. 
Please submit your application via a zip file containing all application source code or a link to a private repository (e.g. Github).
